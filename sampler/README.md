# Sampler

Playing around with the different options PEmbroider has to offer by plopping down circles with random settings.

Generating 23 circles to meet the final plotter theme of "23".

Two modes:

- placing circles randomly within the frame, they'll overlap
- generating circle data using a voronoi tessellation in [codepen](https://codepen.io/lilaconlee/pen/qBJVWEK), copy and pasting into here, distributing circles that way

Note: output files are in a funky directory structure to make them easier to see on the embroidery machine without previews
